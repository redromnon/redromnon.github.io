# This GitHub page is created using LinkFree
I decided to create my own landing page instead of using a third-party tool like LinkTree.

[LinkFree](https://github.com/MichaelBarney/LinkFree) is actually a collection of a variety of templates, all created by the awesome community. You can use one for your social media landing pages. I've used the msmlsm template here.

### Credits
I would sincerely like to thank @MichaelBarney & @ungeschneuer.
